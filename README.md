#Commit Etiquette 


## helper addon in git to make better commit message
### no more test or weird one line commit message


#Feature

## fetch test commits (javacript prefered)
## find good rule base syntax anaylyzer and feed the git diff/commit to analyzer
Example user worked on function testCommit . commit message includes mention of test commit function and 
if user changes parameter , describe parameter change . allow user to make more clarification if needed 
## suggest a commit message, allow user to edit or add on to commit message (utilize git hook ?)
## apply machine learning to make the commit message more "human?" 



# Basic Architecture 
Code will live in git hooks. 
language (can we work in rust please?!)  Blocker with rust , don't know rust 



#User stories 
## Make a test dataset 
### Find good repo with good code commit message and create test data set (for testing and machine learning)
### Create git hooks 
### Research js syntax analyzer 
### Research NLP models for transfer learning (strech goal)
